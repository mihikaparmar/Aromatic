                            you don’t like either of these notes you might not like this either. The jasmine and
                            mimosa are a nice touch since they counteract the bergamot and black currant’s tartness
                            without downplaying it. I wish it lasted longer; I barely managed to get five hours on
                            moisturized skin. It reminds me of a slightly weaker, less sweet Lalique
                            Amethyst.</span></p>

                            shops people asked me what I was wearing. The Air Hostess asked me if I would write down
                            the name of what I was wearing. Hell even men were asking me what I was waering. I have
                            never had so many compliments form a fragrance apart from a few others.</span></p>
